We have read the evolution of programming in the last some decates.
In 1991 Mr. James Gosling create a programming language called Java.
Which is the pure Object Oriented Programming Language.
We know Cpp is not the pure Object Oriented Programming Language.
It vilade some point of OOPs. But belive me it was a great creation.
