NFTs have been used as a means of exchanging digital tokens that link to a digital file. Ownership of an NFT is often associated with a license to use the
underlying digital asset, but generally does not confer copyright to the buyer. Some agreements only grant a license for personal, non-commercial use,
while other licenses also allow commercial use of the underlying digital asset.[29]
Digital art
Some digital art NFTs, like these pixel art characters, are examples of generative art.
Digital art is a common use case for NFTs.[30] High-profile auctions of NFTs linked to digital art have received considerable public attention, with the work
"Merge" by artist Pak being the most expensive NFT with a price of $91.8 million[31] and Everydays: the First 5000 Days, by artist Mike Winkelmann (known
professionally as Beeple), the second most expensive auction at US$69.3 million in 2021.[5][32]
Some NFT collections, including EtherRocks and CryptoPunks are examples of generative art, where many different images can be created by assembling a selection
of simple picture components in different combinations.[33]
In March 2021, the blockchain company Injective Protocol bought a $95,000 original screen print entitled Morons (White) from English graffiti artist Banksy,
and filmed somebody burning it with a cigarette lighter, with the video being minted and sold as an NFT.[34][35] The person who destroyed the artwork, who
called themselves "Burnt Banksy", described the act as a way to transfer a physical work of art to the NFT space.[35]
American curator and art historian Tina Rivers Ryan, who specializes in digital works, has said that art museums are widely not convinced that NFTs represent

Games
Main article: Blockchain game
NFTs can be used to represent in-game assets, such as digital plots of land, which some commentators describe as being controlled "by the user" instead of the
game developer[39] by allowing assets to be traded on third-party marketplaces without permission from the game developer.[40]
CryptoKitties was an early successful blockchain online game where players adopt and trade virtual cats. The monetization of NFTs within the game raised a $12.5
million investment, with some kitties selling for over $100,000 each.[25][41][42] Following its success, CryptoKitties was added to the ERC-721 standard, which
was created in January 2018 (and finalized in June).[43][21] A similar NFT-based online game, Axie Infinity, was launched in March 2018.
In October 2021, developer Valve banned applications that use blockchain technology or NFTs to exchange value or game artifacts from their Steam platform.[44]

announcement has raised significant criticism, with a dislike ratio of 96% over the YouTube announcement video, which has since been unlisted.[45][46] Some 
Ubisoft developers have also raised their concern over the announcement.[47][48][49] The Game Developers Conference's 2022 annual report stated that 70 percent
of developers surveyed said their studios had no interest in integrating NFTs or cryptocurrency into their games.[50][51]
Some luxury brands have minted NFTs for online video game cosmetics.[52] In November 2021, Morgan Stanley published a note suggesting that this use could become
a multi-billion dollar market by 2030.[53]

album.[55][56] On March 3, 2021, an NFT was made to promote the Kings of Leon album When You See Yourself.[57][58][59] Other musicians that have used NFTs include
